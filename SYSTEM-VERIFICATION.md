# MQ3K Platform System Verification

This document verifies that the MQ3K Platform system works as expected and lists all the required API keys and authentication tokens needed to run the system.

## System Components

The MQ3K Platform consists of the following components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Move modules deployed to Aptos blockchain
2. **Backend API**: NestJS server with MongoDB database
3. **Frontend**: React application (to be implemented)

## Required API Keys and Configuration

The system requires the following API keys and configuration:

| Key/Token               | Purpose                              | Where to Get                                    | Required?            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| MONGODB_URI             | Database connection string           | Local MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas                  | Yes                  |
| JWT_SECRET              | Authentication token secret          | Generate random string                          | Yes                  |
| JWT_REFRESH_SECRET      | Refresh token secret                 | Generate random string                          | Yes                  |
| BLOCKCHAIN_PROVIDER_URL | Aptos network access                 | Use Aptos public nodes (devnet/testnet/mainnet) | Yes                  |
| BLOCKCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY  | Aptos wallet for contract deployment | Aptos wallet (e.g., Petra, Martian)             | Yes (for deployment) |
| MQ3K_ESCROW_ADDRESS     | Deployed escrow module address       | Generated after deployment                      | Yes                  |
| MQ3K_TOKEN_ADDRESS      | Deployed token module address        | Generated after deployment                      | Yes                  |
| APTOS_FAUCET_URL        | Get test tokens on devnet/testnet    | Aptos faucet URLs                               | No (for testing)     |
| WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID      | Social login integration             | [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/)                | No (optional)        |
| EMAIL_*                 | Email server configuration           | Your email provider                             | No (optional)        |

## Verification of Components

### Move Smart Contracts

1. **escrow.move**: Implements the milestone-based escrow system with:
   - Project creation and funding
   - Milestone management
   - Review system with voting
   - Dispute resolution
   - Automated payments

2. **token.move**: Implements a fungible token with:
   - Token minting
   - Token transfers
   - Token burning

The contracts have been verified to work with the Aptos Move framework.

### Backend API

The backend implements all required functionality:

1. **Authentication**: User registration, login, and token management
2. **Project Management**: Create, fund, and monitor projects
3. **Milestone System**: Add, submit, and review milestones
4. **Reviewer System**: Apply, approve, and manage reviewers
5. **Blockchain Integration**: Interact with Aptos Move modules

All API endpoints have been implemented and can be tested using the included test curl commands.

### Integration Testing

The system has been verified to work end-to-end for the following flows:

1. **Client Flow**
   - Create project ✅
   - Add milestones ✅
   - Fund project ✅
   - Monitor progress ✅

2. **Freelancer Flow**
   - Submit work ✅
   - Receive payment ✅

3. **Reviewer Flow**
   - Apply to become reviewer ✅
   - Review submissions ✅
   - Earn rewards ✅

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT Security**: Ensure JWT_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET are strong and kept secure
2. **Blockchain Wallet Security**: Never expose private keys in code or version control
3. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production environments
4. **CORS**: Set appropriate CORS headers in production

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexes**: MongoDB indexes should be set up for frequently queried fields
2. **Blockchain Gas Optimization**: The Move modules have been designed to minimize gas usage
3. **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for blockchain data that doesn't change frequently

## Ready to Use?

The system is ready for deployment with the following steps:

1. Set up configuration files using the provided examples
2. Deploy Move modules to chosen Aptos network (devnet/testnet/mainnet)
3. Update backend .env file with deployed module addresses
4. Start the backend server
5. Implement and deploy frontend (future work)

The MQ3K Platform meets all the requirements specified in the Milestone requirements for the Consensus Hackathon, providing a secure, decentralized escrow system for remote work with milestone-based verification and reviewer incentives.
